/**
 * Minimal DES (ECB, PKCS#5) decryption - just enough to unwrap JioSaavn's
 * `encrypted_media_url`, which the Python backend did with pyDes.
 *
 * WebCrypto has no DES, and this runs once per song on a tiny payload, so a
 * plain bit-array implementation is fine and keeps the Worker dependency-free.
